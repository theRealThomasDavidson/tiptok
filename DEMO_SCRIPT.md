## Demo Script (~5.5 minutes, ~100 WPM)

### 1. Introduction (0:00-0:45)
"Hi everyone! I'm excited to share a project I've been working on since arriving in Austin. I haven't made a mobile app yet but decided to design a short-form video platform for job training. [Pause]

WIth this platform we hope to aloow for both retention of segments and to be able to review bite sized chunks as well as to be able to searcha and recall training information without needed to take up too much of an employees or their more senior coworkers time. [Pause]

Let me show you how it works."

### 2. Authentication Demo (0:45-1:30)
[Action: Show sign-in screen]
"First, let's look at the authentication system. We have both sign-up and sign-in functionality, which will be crucial for organizations to keep their training content secure and private. [Pause]

For this demo, I'll use a trainer account I've already set up..."
[Action: Sign in with credentials]

"The authentication system ensures that only authorized personnel can upload and manage training content, while allowing all employees to view the training materials."

### 3. Feed Overview (1:30-2:15)
[Action: Show feed]
"After signing in, you're taken to the main feed. This is where employees will find all available training content. [Pause]

Notice how each video automatically plays and loops - this is intentional. When learning a specific task, being able to watch the demonstration multiple times without manual replay is incredibly helpful. [Pause]

Each video shows who created it and when, maintaining accountability and helping employees find the most current training materials."

### 4. Video Upload and Editing (2:15-3:45)
[Action: Navigate to upload]
"Now, let me demonstrate how trainers can create content. Organizations often have existing training videos, so let's start there. [Pause]

I'll select this longer training video..."
[Action: Select longer video]

"You'll notice it won't upload directly - that's by design. [Pause] We want to keep all content in focused, digestible segments. This helps employees quickly find exactly what they need without watching unnecessary content. [Pause]

Let me show you the editing process..."
[Action: Show trimming interface]

"Using these controls, we can select the exact portion we want to use. [Pause] For this demo, I'll trim this section that shows a specific procedure... [Pause]

Currently, we can create one segment at a time, but I'm working on functionality to split longer videos into multiple segments in one go. This will make it even easier to convert existing training materials."

### 5. Preview and Upload (3:45-4:30)
"Before publishing, it's crucial to verify the content. Let's preview our trimmed segment..."
[Action: Show preview]

"The preview ensures we've captured exactly what we need. [Pause] Once satisfied, we can upload it..."
[Action: Start upload]

"During upload, this progress indicator keeps trainers informed. [Pause] While that's processing, let me show you how quick it is to upload pre-sized content..."

### 6. Quick Upload Demo (4:30-5:00)
[Action: Select short video]
"If you already have a properly sized training clip, like this one, you can upload it directly..."
[Action: Upload short video]

"Notice how much faster this process is when the content is already in the right format."

### 7. Future Features & Conclusion (5:00-5:30)
[Action: Return to feed]
"In future updates, I'll be adding features like:
- Playlist creation for structured training paths
- Search functionality to quickly find specific procedures
- Direct video recording within the app

For now, we've focused on the core functionality: making training content more accessible and manageable. [Pause]

Thank you for watching! Any questions?"
